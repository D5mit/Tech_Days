# This is why Tech-Days are so useful

## Motivation for the project
Can hosting Tech Days be useful for organisations to assist in the transformation 
into data-driven entities? We hosted two Tech Days to find out. After the Techdays
surveys were sent out and this workbook analyses the data inb order to determine if 
Techdays are useful for encouraging technology adoption. 
  
 a summary of the results of the analysis, and necessary acknowledgments.

### Summary of the results of the analysis

<strong>Question 1: Are Tech Days useful to improve adoption of analytics tools?</strong><br>
- The participants of the two Tech Days gave the feedback that the content presented was useful.
- Hosting Tech Days seems to be a useful method in order to improve the likelihood to the adoption of Business Intelligence and Analytics tools.
- The rating on both events were very high. It must be noted that the adoption rate after a Tech Day, might not be as good if the event had not a high rating.

<strong>Question 2: What are some of key elements to hosting a successful Tech Day?</strong><br>
- In order to increase the chances of adoption, ensure that the participants of the Tech Day, understand that if they up-skill and adopt the technologies which is presented during the Tech Day covers, will increase they value to the company they work for.
- Both face to face and virtual events can be useful. There is no need to limit you options only to face to face.
- Tech Days topics should be informative, insightful and relevant. Where possible the topics should be presented in an interactive way using real life practical examples.
- Tech Days should follow a proper agenda with enough breaks and hosted at a appropriate proper venue.


<strong>Question 3: Can we group the participants into groups in order to 
have a more focused approach in the next Tech Day?</strong><br>
- Understand the target audience. It might be that different sessions are required by experienced and less experienced participants.
- Ensure the content presented in the sessions are engaging enough for the target audience.
- When hosting a Tech Day, the target audience of the session should he made clear.
